1. **Introduction**

**Visual tracking has many practical applications in video processing. When a
target is located in one frame of a video, it is often useful to track that
object in subsequent frames. Every frame in which the target is successfully
tracked provides more information about the identity and the activity of the
target. Because tracking is easier than detection, tracking algorithms can use
fewer computational resources than running an object detector on every frame.
Visual tracking has received much attention in recent years. A number of robust
tracking strategies have been proposed that tolerate changes in target
appearance and track targets through complex motions. Recent examples include:
Incremental Visual Tracking (IVT) , Robust Fragments-based Tracking (FragTrack)
, Graph Based Discriminative Learning (GBDL) , and Multiple Instance Learning
(MILTrack) . Although effective, these techniques are not simple; they often
include complex appearance models and/or optimization algorithms, and as result
struggle to keep up with the 25 to 30 frames per second produced by many modern
cameras.**
